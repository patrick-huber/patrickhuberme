    <h3>Rebrand</h3>
    <p>In 2016, TIAA underwent a major rebranding initiative, including a new name, logo, and visual identity. I <a href="#tiaa-management">led</a> the team building the UI system and components for the new <a href="http://tiaa.org">TIAA.org</a> public website, collaborating closely with marketing, design, digital, and technology teams to deliver a cohesive, user-centered experience. The goal was to modernize the public site while improving usability, consistency, and accessibility across the organizationâ€™s digital ecosystem.</p>
    <p>The project involved designing a responsive website from the ground up and developing a scalable UI system to be adopted across all TIAA platforms. I created a comprehensive <a href="#tiaa-styleguide">UI style guide</a>, contributed to the design and documentation of reusable components, and developed <a href="#tiaa-concepts">interactive prototypes</a> for usability testing and stakeholder alignment. The effort resulted in hundreds of redesigned pages and applications supported by a flexible front-end design framework.</p>
    <p>The redesign led to measurable improvements in user experience and engagement: a simplified site structure reduced page count by 50%, improving navigation and clarity around complex retirement topics. User engagement increased by 27%, bounce rates dropped by 41%.</p>

    <h3>Development manager</h3>
    <p>Resource management is a critical part of delivering successful projects. I managed a team of ten front-end architects and developers working on location, from home, and overseas. My experience leading this diverse team has helped me develop the skills necessary to coordinate and manage large scale projects.</p>
    <p>The key areas of TIAA that I oversaw for the front-end team included the public site (<a href="http://tiaa.org">TIAA.org</a>), <a href="#tiaa-rebrand">rebrand</a>, <a href="#tiaa-styleguide">UI style guide</a>, email templates, <a href="http://tiaadirect.com">TIAA Direct</a> banking public site, and <a href="https://www.tiaa.org/public/assetmanagement">TIAA Asset Management</a> site.</p>

    <h3>Technology lead</h3>
    <p>As technology lead, I designed and led the team that built some of the first automated, front-end build systems used at TIAA. Some of the first technologies my team helped introduce at TIAA included mobile-first design, SASS, Gulp, Node.js, Mustache, RequireJS, and ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).</p>
    <p>My first technology lead role at TIAA began with architecting and overseeing the front-end system used by our secure, institutional administrator's website. This grew to include the public site (<a href="http://tiaa.org">TIAA.org</a>), <a href="#tiaa-styleguide">UI style guide</a>, <a href="http://tiaadirect.com">TIAA Direct</a> banking public site, <a href="https://www.tiaa.org/public/assetmanagement">TIAA Asset Management</a> site, email templates, <a href="#tiaa-rebrand">rebrand</a>, TIAA.org mobile site, and accessibility.</p>

    <h3>UI style guide</h3>
    <p>A User Interface (UI) style guide defines the styles and standards for a company to help guide the creation of consistent websites and other display mediums. At TIAA, I built and maintained the style guides used by a team of over fifty UI developers and referenced by numerous other business partners. This involved working directly with UX partners to understand the design standards and rules of use, then develop the final code to be used on the websites.</p>

    <h3>Prototypes and concepts</h3>
    <p>From pencil and paper designs to clickable, interactive prototypes, being able to get initial designs and ideas tested early saves time and money. One of my primary roles during my time at TIAA was to create these clickable prototypes used in usability testing, presentations to stakeholders, and ultimately to create final web pages and apps.</p>
    <p>In addition to creating prototypes for existing projects, I was tasked with envisioning the future state of our websites. These concepts stretched the boundaries of what was currently possible and helped push our technological abilities to the next generation.</p>

    <h3>Front-end development</h3>
    <p>Front-end development is really the "nuts and bolts" of a website; it's the code behind everything you see on a web page. At TIAA, I built components (buttons, navigation menus, carousels, etc.) and web pages that worked across browsers and devices, and were optimized for performance.</p>
