              <h1>Fair Food Finder</h1>
              <p>When the Minnesota State Fair was cancelled in 2020, I designed and built the Fair Food Finder web app to help people discover and locate fair food vendors operating locally. The app reached over 11,000 unique users in the first week and logged more than 150,000 food stand views.</p>

      <p>Survey results showed strong interest in State Fair food, but users didnâ€™t know where to find it or when events were happening. Key user needs included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li id="most-users-were-unaware-of-where-or-when-pop-up-events-were-happening-">Discovering pop-up events in their area</li>

      </ul>
      <p>I also analyzed existing platforms like the MN Food Truck Association, Roaming Hunger, Food Trucks In, and Thrillist. While some listed vendors, they lacked real-time updates, event-specific filtering, and State Fair food coverage. Many also had outdated information or complex vendor sign-up processes.</p>
      <p>This research confirmed a clear opportunity: create a <strong>mobile-first, real-time platform tailored to State Fair food lovers and vendors</strong>, with flexible filters and a simple vendor dashboard.</p>

      <p class="lead">The visual design was inspired by classic fair themes, with bright colors and playful typography. Visual design work included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed a custom logo and UI components</li>
        <li>Developed mobile-first, responsive layouts</li>

      <p>The app was built using React, enabling fast rendering and interactive features. The user experience included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interactive map to explore nearby vendors</li>
        <li>A real-time, searchable list of food vendors</li>
        <li>Filtering by date & hours</li>
        <li>Individual food stand pages with details, directions, and vendor links</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Before the vendor dashboard was fully developed, I used a Google Form to collect vendor data and populate listings manually. This allowed a fast launch and validated vendor interest.</p>

      <p>Strong Vendor interest, combined with large amounts of manual work inputting events, lead me to quickly build the <strong>Vendor Dashboard</strong> in React, and allowed vendors to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create and edit food stand listings</li>
        <li>Add multiple event appearances</li>
        <li>Update information dynamically, without needing support</li>
