      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Cardiac rehab is proven to reduce hospital readmissions, but traditional programs are expensive, difficult to attend,
        and underutilized—less than 20% of eligible patients complete them. Hospitals and clinicians needed a scalable,
        reimbursable way to deliver care beyond the clinic walls. Patients needed a program that felt approachable,
        accessible, and motivating from home.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Translate clinical rehab protocols into <strong>digital, daily patient plans</strong> that were easy to follow.</li>
        <li>Enable care teams to <strong>monitor progress and triage risk</strong> efficiently.</li>
        <li>Improve <strong>patient engagement and adherence</strong> through simple UI and motivational loops.</li>
        <li>Provide <strong>reporting and outcomes data</strong> to support reimbursement and hospital adoption.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>
        I conducted interviews and shadowing with clinicians and patients to understand workflows, barriers, and motivations.
        Insights revealed clinicians struggled with fragmented data and limited time, while patients valued clarity,
        encouragement, and flexibility.
      </p>

      <h3>Ideation & Information Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        Mapped patient and clinician journeys to identify friction points. Defined IA for two complementary experiences:
        a <strong>clinician dashboard</strong> and a <strong>patient mobile app</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Wireframing & Prototyping</h3>
      <p>
        Created low-fidelity flows to validate task efficiency (triage, messaging, reporting) with care teams.
        Iterated high-fidelity prototypes for usability testing with both patients and clinicians.
      </p>

      <h3>UI Design & Design System</h3>
      <p>
        Developed a scalable design system with accessible components (WCAG AA compliant), flexible color tokens, and
        modular layouts for quick iteration across features. Balanced clinical seriousness with a supportive, friendly
        aesthetic for patients.

      <p>
        The platform successfully scaled cardiac rehabilitation beyond hospital walls—improving access for patients while
        reducing clinician workload. Engagement rates tripled, patients achieved health outcomes equivalent to traditional
        programs, and hospitals gained the data needed to support reimbursement. This case demonstrates how thoughtful design
        can align clinical rigor with usability to drive both business adoption and patient impact.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Designing at Chanl Health meant shaping software around both clinical rigor and human empathy.
        I learned to balance the complexity of medical workflows with the need for simplicity and motivation
        in patient-facing design. The experience strengthened my ability to translate domain expertise
        into approachable digital products that drive measurable outcomes.
