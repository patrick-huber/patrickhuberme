              <h1>Vēmos Venue Management</h1>
              <p>As head of product at Vemos, I led the team through the strategy, design, and development of a simple yet powerful venue management app that streamlined guest entry, reservations, and payments for nightlife and hospitality venues.</p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Nightlife venues, concert halls, restaurants, and other hospitality spaces often juggle multiple guest entry systems—VIP tables, guestlists, walk-up admissions, ticketing—leading to confusion at the door,
        disjointed data, and poor guest experiences. Venue teams needed a unified, easy-to-learn system that could handle every type of entry, process any kind of payment, and surface real-time guest insights—all through one app.
      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Consolidate VIP reservations, guestlist, and general admission workflows into a single user interface.</li>
        <li>Enable seamless cover charge collection via cash, credit, or digital payments.</li>
        <li>Capture rich guest profile data for personalized experiences and promoter attribution.</li>
        <li>Deliver a platform that’s intuitive to set up and simple to operate, integrating with powerful analytics behind the scenes.</li>
      </ul>

      </div>

      <h3>Discovery & Research</h3>
      <p>
        As product lead, I guided research sessions with venue operators to uncover key challenges: fragmented guest management, slow check-ins, and limited promoter visibility.
        These insights confirmed the need for a unified tool that simplified operations while capturing rich guest and promoter data.
      </p>

      <h3>Feature Definition & Design</h3>
      <p>
        Core features were defined around VIP reservations, guestlist management, general admission, and guest profiles.
        I built wireframes and interactive prototypes that emphasized speed, clarity, and real-time visibility, with color-coded guest statuses and one-tap payment flows.
        Iterative feedback sessions using prototypes with venue staff ensured the design addressed actual operational needs.

        </figure>
      </div>

      <h3>Development with React Native</h3>
      <p>
        The app was built using <strong>React Native</strong> to ensure consistent performance across iOS and Android, enabling a single codebase and native-like speed.
        We implemented offline-first workflows to handle low-connectivity venues, and I collaborated with engineers on reusable component patterns and efficient data handling.
        This setup allowed rapid iteration and seamless incorporation of pilot feedback.
      </p>

      <h3>Pilot Venue Trials</h3>
      <p>
        After core features were ready, we ran live trials at partner venues. Observing staff at the door highlighted friction points in navigation, check-ins, and payments.
        Structured feedback and analytics from these pilots informed the next iteration: simplifying app navigation, optimizing payment flows, and improving guest profile visibility for faster, smoother operations.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Leading the product effort at Vēmos taught me how to align cross-functional teams around a clear vision, prioritize high-impact features, and design for operational clarity in high-pressure environments. 
        Building with React Native and testing in real venues reinforced the importance of technical choices and iterative feedback loops in creating tools that empower both staff and guests.
